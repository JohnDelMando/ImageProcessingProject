# **Image Processing Project**

This project is an implementation of several fundamental image processing algorithms, designed to perform edge detection and line extraction on a grayscale image. Specifically, it applies the Laplacian Operator for zero-crossing detection, Sobel Operator for gradient computation, Edge Image Generation based on thresholding, and the Hough Transform to detect and highlight the three longest linear structures in the image.

## **Key Features**

* **Laplacian Operator**: Detects zero-crossing points to highlight regions in the image where pixel intensity changes rapidly, indicating possible edges.
* **Sobel Operator**: Computes the gradient at each pixel in both the X and Y directions, emphasizing edges by highlighting areas of high gradient magnitude.
* **Edge Image Generation**: Combines zero-crossing results with Sobel gradients to form a binary edge map, highlighting prominent edges based on a specified threshold.
* **Hough Transform**: Identifies and highlights linear structures within the edge-detected image, extracting the three longest lines.

## **Implementation Details**

* **Laplacian Operator**: the Laplacian operator is applied to the grayscale image to identify zero-crossing points, which typically indicate the presence of edges. If the Laplacian value exceeds a given threshold, the pixel is marked as part of an edge.

* **Sobel Operator**: this operator calculates the gradient magnitude at each pixel by convolving the image with Sobel kernels for both the X and Y directions. The gradient magnitude is computed as the square root of the sum of squared gradient values, then clipped to a maximum intensity (255) to form a clearer edge map.

* **Edge Image Generation**: an edge image is generated by combining the zero-crossing map from the Laplacian with the gradient map from the Sobel operator. A pixel is considered an edge if it appears as a zero-crossing and has a gradient value above a specified threshold.

* **Hough Transform**: the Hough transform detects lines in the edge image by identifying accumulator peaks corresponding to probable line structures. This implementation finds the top three longest lines, represented by rho (distance from origin) and theta (angle), and highlights them on the output image.

## **What I Learned**
* Image Gradient Computation using Sobel and Laplacian operators, which are commonly used for edge detection.
* Threshold-Based Edge Detection by combining zero-crossing points with gradient magnitudes to create a binary edge map.
* Hough Transform for Line Detection, including accumulator voting and extracting lines with prominent edges.
